### 文章、教程与话题

[我是如何做出一个怎么投篮都能进的篮框的？](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtN4tkvcBMA) ![img](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e2e180baf855ac797ef407fc7/images/8def3887-e9e9-4a48-95e0-74045a6a23fc.png)(22min)
想象一下，投了一个球，如果球撞到了篮板，就会莫名其妙的直接进到篮筐里。由于物理原因，尽管你可以使球更多地进入篮筐，但是不可能使所有可能的投篮都能进。这个视频向你展示了如何编写一个程序来计算光学背板然后进行加工制作。

[在 Rust 代码中编写 Python 代码 — 第一部分](https://blog.m-ou.se/writing-python-inside-rust-1/)
大约一年前，我发布了一个叫 `inline-python` 的 `Rust create`，允许你使用 `python!{ .. }` 宏很轻松的在你的 `Rust` 代码中混入一些 `Python` 代码。在这个章节中，我将从零开始讲述这个 `create` 的开发过程。

- [Part 1A](https://blog.m-ou.se/writing-python-inside-rust-1a/) - 在第二部分继续扩展我们的 `python!{}` 宏之前，我们先详细探讨一些事情。

Let's walk through how one would build their own end-to-end speech recognition model in PyTorch. The model we'll build is inspired by Deep Speech 2 (Baidu's second revision of their now-famous model) with some personal improvements to the architecture. The output of the model will be a probability matrix of characters, and we'll use that probability matrix to decode the most likely characters spoken from the audio.

Ensemble learning is a machine learning paradigm where multiple models (often called “weak learners”) are trained to solve the same problem and combined to get better results. There are three most common types of ensembles: + Bagging + Boosting + Stacking. In this post we will start with bagging, and then move on to boosting and stacking in separate publications.

[pip 20.1b1 beta release](https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-1b1-beta-release/3960)
The highlights for this release are:

- Significant speedups when building local directories, by changing behavior to perform in-place builds, instead of copying to temporary directories.
- Significant speedups in pip list --outdated, by parallelizing network access. This is the first instance of parallel code within pip’s codebase.
- A new pip cache command, which makes it possible to introspect and manage pip’s cache directory.
- Better pip freeze for packages installed from direct URLs, enabled by the implementation of PEP 610.


[PyTorch 1.5](https://t.co/0DlxDEQQsP)
The release features several major new API additions and improvements, including a significant update to the C++ frontend, Channel Last memory format for computer vision models, and a stable release of the distributed RPC framework used for model-parallel training.
